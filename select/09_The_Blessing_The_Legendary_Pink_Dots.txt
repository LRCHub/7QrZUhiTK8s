Don't worry dear he likes you, it's the way he craves attention
Don't you think those rolling eyes are cute?
He gots his woe he must admit, the power of those hands
Touching here touching there, touching places you don't know yourself
Lie back, enjoy it
It's a clean thing, a holy blessing
A holy blessing
Feel the spirits burning deep inside
Sliding in and out in and out
Take it willing, take it proud, smash the walls of jericho

Smash the walls of Jericho
Smash the walls of Jericho
Smash the walls
Smash the walls
Smash the walls
Smash the walls
