It was a painful day of summer
I was thinking wicked thoughts
My mind was full of hatred
And my emotions were running low

My hands started trembling
And my heart was beating fast
My vision became blurry
And the anger spread like dust

A moment of pure silence
Something blazed the sky
A lightning split the daylight
And heavy rain burst out

I was in deep frustration
As I was watching to the void
And then a shade approached me
And she told me that I was lost

She said that she could help me
It is my inner self I thought
I watched her apparition
And she had turn into a white dove

Her words made me shiver
As I was watching her flying away
Serenity inundated me
How peaceful I became in the end
